Exercise 4 â€” Simple 2-clique projection (neighbors & degrees)

Goal
----
Compute the pairwise (2-clique) projection:
- Two nodes are adjacent if they co-occur in at least one hyperedge.

Implement:
- clique_projection_neighbors(hg) -> dict {node: set(neighbors)}
- clique_projection_degree(hg)    -> dict {node: int}  (size of its neighbor set)

Hints
-----
- For each node u, iterate over hg.get_incident_edges(u).
- For each such edge, add all other members of the edge as neighbors of u.
- Keep neighbors symmetric (if v is in N[u], ensure u is in N[v]).
