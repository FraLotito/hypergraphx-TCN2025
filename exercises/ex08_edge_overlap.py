Exercise 08 â€” Top-K hyperedge overlaps (Jaccard)

Implement:
- topk_edge_jaccard(hg, k) -> list of tuples: [(edge_key1, edge_key2, jaccard), ...]
  where each edge_key is a sorted tuple of node labels and the list is sorted by:
  (jaccard DESC, edge_key1 ASC, edge_key2 ASC). Always ensure edge_key1 < edge_key2.
