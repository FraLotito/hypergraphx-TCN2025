Exercise 14 â€” Five seeded random hypergraphs with different majority edge sizes

Implement:
- generate_five_majority(n_min=10, e_min=10, seed=None) -> list[Hypergraph]

Requirements
------------
- Use HGX: from hypergraphx.generation.random import random_hypergraph
- Return exactly 5 hypergraphs.
- For i in [0..4], hypergraph i must have a STRICT MAJORITY of its hyperedges
  of size S_i, where S = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
- Each hypergraph must have at least n_min nodes and at least e_min hyperedges.
- Make the result reproducible with `seed` (e.g., derive seeds as seed+i).

Starter
-------
Keep the NotImplementedError until you implement the function.
