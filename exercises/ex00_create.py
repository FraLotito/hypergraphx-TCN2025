"""
Exercise 0 â€” Create a tiny hypergraph (HGX)

Goal
----
Build and return a Hypergraph with exactly 8 distinct nodes and 5 hyperedges.
Use string labels for nodes (e.g., "A".."H"). Hyperedges may overlap.

What to use
-----------
- Hypergraph(), add_nodes([...]), add_edges([(...), ...])
- num_nodes(), num_edges() are used by tests (not needed here).
